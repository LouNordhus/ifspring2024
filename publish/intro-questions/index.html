   I don't have a lot of experience with coding  
   but computer science and coding is something 
   I've been wanting to learn more about for a long time,<br> I just was not sure where to start. 
   I really want to understand coding for websites so it can help 
   better inform the layouts I design for digital platforms.<br>

    I only know a few really basic JS commands like how to make a comment or print a line of text.

I would think that color choice is important because it needs to be a high contrast enough color palette to be readable.

    <a href="https://www.tonkohouse.com"> Tonko House's website</a><br>
    I think Tonko House's website exhibits effective design because they were able to make a sleek, simple layout feel exciting and immersive with the full bleed images they use.<br>
    I also like how the elements of the website are animated and fade in when you click from page to page.

   <a href="https://www.fatchoynyc.com">Fat Choy restaurant 's website </a><br>

   I think Fat Choy restaurant's website exemplifies effective communication because it immediately tells you what kind of restaurant they are when you first click on it. <br>
   They also limited their pages in the menu bar to only the necessities- the home page, menu with their food items, and their press/reviews.

    <a href="https://www.apple.com/mac/">Apple's Macbook part of their website</a><br>
    I think the macbook page of Apple's website is a good example of a website that works well because it has very complex scroll animations<br> and video animations playing throughout the whole page but it is still able to respond to however the user is scrolling or interacting with it without glitching.
